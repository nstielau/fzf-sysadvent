# Awesome command-line fuzzy finding with fzf

## It's all about the CLIUX

Ok, CLIUX is not a word, but command-line interface user experience is definitely a worthy consideration, especially 
if you use the command line on a daily basis (or, hourly).  Web apps and graphical user interfaces usually get the 
design love, but this holiday season, treat yourself to a great command line user experience.   

Now that we're thinking about CLIUX, we can roll up our sleeves and see how we can improve some of our everyday command line 
operations.  This can be as simple as [adding in some colors](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) to our shell prompts or big as [changing over to a new shell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/).  

We're going to focus on a few ways to make finding things easier.

## Enter FZF
A lot of CLI is about finding stuff.  Sometimes that is finding the right files to edit, or searching through git logs 
to review, or finding a a process Id or user Id to use as a parameters for other commands (kill, chgrp, etc).

[Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/) is a fuzzy finder, a CLI tool that is explicitly meant to bridge the technical 
need to find things with the user need to find them easily.  Written by [junegunn](https://github.com/junegunn), 
it has been around for a few years, but this is the year you use it to make your CLIUX awesome.

FZF adheres to the Unix Philosophy of [doing one thing, and doing it well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well) and valuing composability.  These two characteristics make it likely we can find lots of ways to use fuzzy finding, and to integrate it into our daily operations.

## Using FZF

### Getting started

You can install FZF with package managers, `brew install fzf` for OSX and `dnf install fzf` for Fedora, or check out 
the [full installation instructions](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation) for other options.  Once you've got 
it installed, we'll start fuzzy finding! 

### Step 1) Piping data into FZF

We'll start off looking at how we can pipe a input set to `fzf` and then pipe the selected value to another utility.  Fzf can fuzzy search any input from stdin.  For starters, let's pipe our dictionary through `fzf`,

```
cat /usr/share/dict/words | fzf
```

and start typing to narrow down the list to matching words: `c` `l` `n` `j` `f` `i`.  Ok, so there is one word out of the 235,886 in the dictionary that 
contains those letters in that order.  Clanjamfrie.  

![Searching for clanjamfrie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nstielau/fzf-sysadvent/master/images/clanjamfrie.png)

It's a Scottish word that means spoken nonsense, as in"Anyone who doesnâ€™t like fuzzy finding is just spouting 
clanfamfrie". Who knew?  


### Step 2) Piping data out of FZF

Now we are getting somewhere.  Selecting a dictionary word is pretty useful, but how can we make this really great?  That's right, piping our selected word to `cowsay`.

```
cat /usr/share/dict/words | fzf | cowsay
```

![fzf and cowsay FTW](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nstielau/fzf-sysadvent/master/images/cowsay.png)

### Step 3) Live preview

Sysadmins everywhere are on the edge of their seats.  Cowsay, dictionaries, fuzzy finding.  How can we take this to the next level?

Using the `--preview` flag, we can specify a program for a live preview of our `fzf` selection.  In this case, we can get a preview of exactly how the cow will say it:

```
cat /usr/share/dict/words | fzf --preview "cowsay {}" | cowsay
```

![Preview that moo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nstielau/fzf-sysadvent/master/images/imagine.png)

## Step 4) Gitting More Pragmatic

Not that cowsay isn't a real world use-case, but let's get into something more pragmatic, like... git!  This gem of an example is from the [ample examples on the fzf wiki](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/examples) (although paired down a bit for consumability here).  It shows how to search though git logs and examine a diff.
```
# fshow - git commit browser
fshow() {
  git log --graph --color=always \
      --format="%C(auto)%h%d %s %C(black)%C(bold)%cr" "$@" |
  fzf --ansi --bind "enter:execute:
                (grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{7\}' | head -1 |
                xargs -I % sh -c 'git show --color=always % | less -R') << 'FZF-EOF'
                {}
FZF-EOF"
}
```

The big new addition here is the `--bind` option, which can specify a program to execute upon key press or selection.  The `fshow` function uses this functionality to view the git diff with `less` when enter is pressed.

Here's the `fshow` function running against the `fzf` codebase:

## Step 5) Make viewing diffs easy

This is pretty cool, but we already know how to make it cooler.  With `--preview`!

```
fshow() {
  git log --graph --color=always \
      --format="%C(auto)%h%d %s %C(black)%C(bold)%cr" "$@" |
  fzf --ansi --preview "echo {} | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{7\}' | head -1 | xargs -I % sh -c 'git show --color=always %'" \
             --bind "enter:execute:
                (grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{7\}' | head -1 |
                xargs -I % sh -c 'git show --color=always % | less -R') << 'FZF-EOF'
                {}
FZF-EOF"
}
```

Wow! Does anyone else feel like we just implemented Github in like 6 lines?!?!

## Autocompletion

Autocompletion is easy to set up too, `fzf` comes with scripts, configuration variables, and docs for [integrating `fzf` with your shell for autocompletion](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#fuzzy-completion-for-bash-and-zsh).  This gives you some `fzf` goodness for standard commands like `kill`, `ssh`, etc

## Conclusion

If you want to spruce up your command line user experience, dig in with `fzf` and put the power of fuzzy finding to use.  Junegunn's `fzf` is a simple, composable tool that can make your command line more efficient and usable for 2018.
